# curiosity_map.unexplored_areas: [BottleneckTask(...), ...]
# curiosity_map.exploration_suggestions: [
#   {
#     "curiosity_prompt": "What if we just peeked at learning React? No commitment...",
#     "duration": "15 minutes",
#     "commitment_level": "None - just exploring"
#   }
# ]

# Suggest exploration
opportunity = await compass.suggest_exploration(
    user_id="user-123",
    strength=user_strength
)
# opportunity.exploration_prompt: "I wonder what React is actually like? Let's explore..."
# opportunity.what_you_might_discover: [
#   "How React components actually work",
#   "Why people find React valuable",
#   "A new angle on React you hadn't considered"
# ]
# opportunity.no_commitment_message: "Just 15 minutes to explore. No pressure to continue."

# Record discovery
result = await compass.record_discovery(
    user_id="user-123",
    bottleneck_id="bottleneck-456",
    discovery="React components are actually quite intuitive!",
    wants_to_continue=True
)
# result.celebration_message: "Fascinating discovery! You learned: React components..."
# result.next_exploration: ExplorationOpportunity(...)
```

## 🎯 Key Design Principles

### Protégé Effect Implementation
**Research-Backed Approach:**
- Teaching deepens understanding (protégé effect)
- Active recall through explanation
- Knowledge gap revelation
- Confidence building through teaching
- Identity shift (user as "teacher")

**UX Philosophy:**
- User teaches AI "student" (not passive consumption)
- Encouraging feedback (builds teaching confidence)
- Quality scoring (clarity, completeness, depth)
- Pride-based motivation (celebration of teaching)

### Curiosity-Driven Exploration
**Low-Stakes Design:**
- "Just 15 minutes" commitment
- No pressure to complete
- Escape hatch always available
- Discovery-focused (not obligation-focused)

**Reframing Strategy:**
- Bottlenecks → curiosities
- "Should do" → "Might discover"
- Avoidance → exploration opportunity
- Anxiety → safe investigation

---

## 🔄 Integration with Existing System

### FFE Components Used
1. **GrowthScaffold** - Bottleneck detection for curiosity opportunities
2. **ScopingAgent** - 15-minute exploration block creation
3. **StrengthAmplifier** - Strength-based task reframing
4. **GoalIngestor** - Teaching goal creation
5. **MultiModelOrchestrator** - AI-powered generation

### Data Flow

#### Teaching Mode Flow:
```
User → "Learn X" Goal
  ↓
Teaching Interface → Reframe as "Teach me X"
  ↓
Protégé Pipeline → Generate student questions (AI/templates)
  ↓
User explains → Evaluation (clarity, completeness, depth)
  ↓
Student feedback → Follow-up questions or celebration
  ↓
Session complete → Teaching quality score + ARI impact
```

#### Exploration Mode Flow:
```
User → Bottleneck detected (GrowthScaffold)
  ↓
Curiosity Compass → Reframe as exploration opportunity
  ↓
Generate curiosity prompt (AI/templates)
  ↓
Create 15-min exploration block (ScopingAgent)
  ↓
Optional: Reframe via strength (StrengthAmplifier)
  ↓
User explores → Record discovery
  ↓
Celebrate discovery (not completion) → Offer continuation
```
